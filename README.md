# virtual_bingo

When COVID-19 hit my office transitioned to WFH full-time pretty quickly. I am the founder and leader of my company's data and analytics user group, which meets monthly, and I was looking for a way to keep meeting attendees engaged during our virtual monthly meetings. This is why I created this virtual bingo caller and card set. Here is a way for players to play bingo without all of the annoying ads that accompany the free online bingo cards, and a way for callers to call without the investment of a bingo cage.

## how to play

1. Players will want to download the Virtual_Bingo_Cards.xlsm macro-enabled Microsoft Excel workbook

2. Once opened players will need to select the macro button labeled "CLICK TO SAVE CARDS" which will copy and paste the values in their cards to eliminate cell formulas and prevent their cards from changing in the middle of a game
3. The caller will want to download and open the Virtual_Bingo_Caller.ipynb notebook and run the first __ cells to generate the list of calls
4. Once the players are all ready to play the caller will run cell ___ once, call the value that appears on the screen, and continue this step until a player yells "BINGO!"
5. Once a player has bingo the caller can check the values of the players bigno using the list of calls that has been appended to with each call in cell ____
6. If at any time the player does not like their card, or they run out of cards to play they can select the macro button labeled "CLICK TO RESET CARDS" to reset their card values. After this they will want to select the macro button "CLICK TO SAVE CARDS" before continuing to play

### I hope you enjoy this fun and easy way to connect virtually with friends, family, and colleagues!
